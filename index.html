                    <p>That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. You have to make these big decisions. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.

                        You can spend all day playing with mountains. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Be brave. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.
                        
                        I like to beat the brush. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.
                        
                        Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Every time you practice, you learn more. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends.
                        
                        You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school.
                        
                        So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? All kinds of happy little splashes. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.
                        
                        It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. This is the way you take out your flustrations.
